Simply select a starting chord and the palette will show you harmonically related options, making it easy to craft compelling progressions. You can drag and drop voicings directly to your timeline, instantly transpose keys, and create custom chord banks to develop your personal harmonic vocabulary."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes the Melody Pattern Constructor special?",
        "answer": "The Melody Pattern Constructor helps you develop compelling melodies that complement your chord progressions. It suggests contextually appropriate melodic patterns based on your harmonic choices, allows you to experiment with different rhythmic variations, and provides intuitive tools for crafting memorable themes.

        "question": "How do patterns adapt to chord changes?",
        "answer": "Cymasphere's Dynamic Pattern Editor uses intelligent algorithms to adapt melodic patterns to your chord progressions in real-time. When you change a chord, the system automatically adjusts the pattern to maintain harmonic coherence while preserving the musical intent of your melody. This works in both relative and absolute modes, giving you flexibility to create context-aware melodies or fixed melodic content as needed."

      {
        "question": "What makes the Voicing Generator special?",
        "answer": "The Voicing Generator uses advanced algorithms to create rich, musically satisfying chord voicings that follow proper voice leading principles.

Settings can be applied globally or adjusted for specific sections of your composition."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the differences between the standalone app and the plugin?",
        "answer": "The standalone app and plugin versions share the same core features and functionality.
