# Plugin Setup in DAW (Logic)

Goal

- Insert Cymasphere as a plugin and route its MIDI to an instrument track.

Steps (Logic)

1. On a Software Instrument track, insert Cymasphere in the MIDI FX slot (or on a utility/instrument track per template).
2. Create another Software Instrument track (the sound source) if needed; set it to receive MIDI from the plugin track.
3. Arm/monitor the instrument track; trigger a voicing in Cymasphere; verify meters.

Tips

- Keep plugin track and instrument track names clear (e.g., “Cymasphere MIDI” and “Piano”).

Troubleshooting

- No sound: inserted on an audio slot; move to a MIDI‑capable insert.
- Instrument not responding: input/monitor not set; track not armed.
