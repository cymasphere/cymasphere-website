# Cymasphere Tracks: MIDI Out

Goal

- Control per‑track MIDI outputs, set a bass channel, and leverage the voice→channel matrix.

Steps

1. Open the track’s MIDI Out settings → choose the target channel/port.
2. Set the bass channel if you want the lowest voice on a dedicated channel.
3. Open the Voice Channel Matrix → map voices (1–12 + bass) to specific MIDI channels.
4. In your DAW, ensure instruments listen on the channels you’ve assigned.

Tips

- Keep a consistent channel plan (e.g., bass on 2, upper voices on 1).

Troubleshooting

- Instrument not reacting: listening on a different channel; set to Omni or match the channel map.
