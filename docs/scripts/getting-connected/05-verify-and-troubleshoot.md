# Verify & Troubleshoot

Goal

- Confirm your routing works and fix common issues fast.

Checklist

- Virtual MIDI port (Standalone) or plugin insert (Plugin mode) is correct.
- Instrument track is armed/monitoring and receiving the right input.
- Meters move in Cymasphere and the instrument track.
- Buffer size: 128–256 samples to balance latency/stability.

Quick fixes

- Reassign track input/output to the expected ports.
- Toggle monitor/record; reload the instrument plugin.
- Reduce buffer if latency is distracting; increase if unstable.
- Check channel filters on the instrument and the DAW track.
