# Track Tab

Goal

- Manage tracks quickly.

What you’ll do

- View/add tracks, solo/mute, and access sequencer-related actions.

Steps

1. Open Track Tab → review current tracks and types.
2. Add a track; show basic properties.
3. Solo/mute a track; verify routing still works in Logic.

Tip

- For sound, ensure Logic’s Software Instrument track is armed/monitoring and receiving MIDI.
