# Welcome to Cymasphere (Logic Plugin)

Goal

- Get oriented fast: where things live and what you can do right now.

What you’ll do

- Load Cymasphere as a plugin in Logic, tour the core tabs, and see where help and settings live.

Quick setup (Logic)

- Insert Cymasphere on a MIDI-capable slot (e.g., MIDI FX on a Software Instrument).
- Create/enable a Software Instrument track to receive MIDI from Cymasphere. Arm/monitor it so meters respond.

Tour the interface

- Topbar Navigation: global area for switching views and common actions.
- Tabs:
  - Song: project-level context, songs and properties.
  - Track: track list, types, and per-track actions.
  - Palette: cymatic buttons (voicings), expressions, banks.
  - Voicing: sound-shaping controls (voice count, octave, spacing, inversion, sustain, strum, smart chord, voice leading).
- User Menu: account, preferences, Help/About.

Verify output quickly

- Trigger a cymatic (Palette) or play a voicing (Voicing) and confirm the Software Instrument track shows meter activity.

Next steps

- Workspace for the mental model (Song → Track → Palette → Voicing).
- Create Your First Project to save and make sound quickly.

Troubleshooting

- No sound: the instrument track isn’t armed/monitoring or routing is incorrect. Cymasphere generates MIDI, not audio.
- Inserted on wrong slot: use a MIDI-capable insert (Logic MIDI FX or proper instrument routing).
