# Workspace: Songs, Tracks, Palettes

Goal

- Understand the mental model so you know where to do what.

What you’ll do

- Navigate the four core tabs and see how Song → Track → Palette → Voicing relate.

Interfaces to show

- Song Tab: song browser/properties.
- Track Tab: track list, track types, per‑track actions.
- Palette Tab: cymatic buttons (voicings), expressions, banks.
- Voicing Tab: voice count, octave, spacing, inversion, sustain, strum, smart chord, voice leading.

Steps

1. Open Song Tab → note project context and properties.
2. Switch to Track Tab → view/add tracks; see types and basic controls.
3. Switch to Palette Tab → trigger a cymatic; open expressions; note banks.
4. Switch to Voicing Tab → adjust voice count and octave; see keyboard display react.

Notes

- Theory is covered in dedicated videos; here we focus on where to perform tasks.

Pitfalls

- Expecting voicing edits in Song/Track tabs. Use the Voicing Tab for sound shaping.
- Confusing Palette storage with track state. Palettes store voicings (cymatics/expressions).
