# Create Your First Project

Goal

- Create a song, add a track, and hear output in Logic.

What you’ll do

- Make a new song, add a voicing track, route to a Software Instrument, and play.

Steps

1. Song Tab → New Song → name it → Save.
2. Track Tab → Add Track → select a voicing track.
3. Palette Tab → press a cymatic (or Voicing Tab → play a voicing).
4. Logic: ensure the Software Instrument track is monitoring/armed and receiving MIDI from the Cymasphere plugin track.
5. Transport → Play to verify meters and sound.

Tips

- Save early; use clear project names.
- Use a basic piano plugin first to verify MIDI.

Pitfalls

- No sound: instrument track not armed or routing not set.
- Inserted on audio slot: move Cymasphere to a MIDI-capable insert.
