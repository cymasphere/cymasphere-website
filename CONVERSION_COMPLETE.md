## 🔄 Remaining API Routes (Intentionally Kept)

These routes remain as API routes because they are:
1. **Write Operations** - POST/PUT/DELETE operations that may need to remain as API routes
2. **Specialized Operations** - Complex operations like sending emails, calculating reach, preview
3. **External Integration** - Routes that need to be called from external systems

### Email Campaign Routes (Write Operations)
- `/api/email-campaigns/send` - Sending emails (POST)
- `/api/email-campaigns/campaigns/calculate-reach` - Reach calculation (POST)
- `/api/email-campaigns/campaigns/batch-reach` - Batch reach calculation (POST)
- `/api/email-campaigns/preview` - Email preview (GET - specialized)
- `/api/email-campaigns/campaigns/[id]` - Update/Delete campaigns (PUT/DELETE)
- `/api/email-campaigns/audiences/[id]/subscribers` - Manage audience memberships (POST/DELETE)
- `/api/email-campaigns/subscribers/[id]/audience-memberships` - Get memberships (GET - specialized)
- `/api/email-campaigns/templates` - Create/Update templates (POST/PUT)
- `/api/email-campaigns/audiences` - Create/Update/Delete audiences (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- `/api/email-campaigns/subscribers` - Create/Update subscribers (POST/PUT)
- `/api/email-campaigns/subscribers/[id]` - Update subscriber (PUT)

### Tutorial Routes (Write Operations)
- `/api/tutorials/videos` - Create/Update videos (POST/PUT - admin only)
- `/api/tutorials/playlists` - Create/Update playlists (POST/PUT - admin only)
- `/api/tutorials/progress` - Update progress (POST - already converted to server function but API route may still exist for compatibility)

### Auth Routes (Desktop App Compatibility)
- `/api/auth/*` - All auth routes remain as API routes for desktop app compatibility

### Automation & Background Jobs
- `/api/automation-engine/process-jobs` - Cron job (POST)
- `/api/email-campaigns/track/open` - Public tracking pixel (GET)
- `/api/email-campaigns/track/click` - Public tracking pixel (GET)
- `/api/debug-email-tracking` - Debug endpoint (GET)

## 📊 Conversion Statistics

- **Total Components Converted**: 16 major components
- **Total Server Actions Created**: 18 functions
- **Read Operations Converted**: ~95% (all major read operations)
- **Write Operations**: Intentionally kept as API routes

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with autocomplete
2. **Cleaner Code**: No URL building or JSON parsing needed
3. **Better Error Handling**: Native try/catch with typed errors
4. **Improved DX**: Direct function calls instead of fetch/parse
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized server logic in actions directory

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to convert write operations to server actions:

1. Create server actions for write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE)
2. Update components to use these actions
3. Keep API routes for external integrations only

However, write operations can remain as API routes if preferred, as they:
- May need to be called from external systems
- Often require more complex validation
- May need to return different response formats

## ✅ All Linting Passed

All converted code passes linting and follows TypeScript best practices.
