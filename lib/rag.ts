- Chord Progression Framework serving as the harmonic foundation for your compositions
- Informative Keyboard Display showing chord voicings and voice leading

### Harmony Palettes
The Interactive Harmony Palette provides a visual, gestural interface for exploring chord relationships. Features include:
- Customizable library organization with drag-and-drop chord collection management
- Direct drag-and-drop voicings from palette to your progression timeline
- Curated collection libraries with preselected scales and chord relationships
- One-click key transposition to instantly change the key of entire compositions
- Voicing parameter panel for quick chord characteristic adjustments
- Custom library creation to build your personal harmonic vocabulary

### Dynamic Pattern Editor
The Dynamic Pattern Editor enables you to create complex musical motifs that respond intelligently to changes in your chord progressions. Features include:
- Intelligent Adaptation to chord progression changes in real-time
- Advanced Piano Roll Interface with powerful editing tools
- Context-Aware Note Entry with scale, chord, and voicing intelligence to prevent harmonic clashes
- Dual Mode Operation with relative and absolute patterns for both contextual and fixed melodic content
- Melodic Essence Extraction that captures the intent of any melody for reuse in different harmonic contexts

### Voicing Generator
The Voicing Generator uses advanced algorithms to create rich, musically satisfying chord voicings that follow proper voice leading principles. It analyzes chord progressions to ensure smooth voice transitions between chords, with controls for voicing width, density, inversions, and harmonic extensions.

## How It Works

### CREATE Workflow
1. **Start with Chord Progressions**: Begin with pre-crafted templates or effortlessly build your own chord progressions by dragging voicings from the Harmony palette. The app automatically analyzes scales and modes, ensuring your music follows proper theory principles.
2. **Layer Multiple Tracks**: Create rich compositions with multiple tracks that intelligently work together. Add harmony, melodies, and rhythmsâ€”all synchronized and harmonically compatible with your chord progression.
3. **Customize with Precision**: Fine-tune your sound with detailed customization. Adjust inversions, voicing density, tension notes, and harmonic extensions to craft everything from simple triads to complex jazz harmonies.
4. **Intelligent Musicality**: Experience professional-level musicality with intelligent voice leading that ensures smooth chord transitions. Access composition tools previously available only to trained musicians, empowering you to create sophisticated harmonies with confidence.

### LEARN Workflow
1. **Ghost Track Learning**: Master chord progressions through interactive ghost tracks that guide your playing. Experiment with reharmonization in real-time, watching as the app adapts to your creative choices while maintaining musical coherence.
2. **Interactive Harmonic Analysis**: Explore comprehensive harmonic displays that reveal the theory behind your music. Visualize voicings, patterns, scales, and chords in real-time, gaining deep insights into the musical structure of your creations.
3. **Pattern-Based Learning**: Start with a simple pattern and watch it evolve as you explore different scales and chord qualities. The app's visual feedback helps you understand how each note contributes to the overall harmony.
4. **Refine Your Skills**: Improve your musical ear by experimenting with different chord substitutions and modal interchange. Develop a deeper understanding of chord qualities and progressions.

### INTEGRATE Workflow
1. **DAW Compatibility**: Use Cymasphere as a standalone application or as a VST/AU plugin within your DAW. Whether you're sketching ideas independently or integrating directly into your production, the app adapts to your preferred workflow.
2. **Multi-Track Control**: Manage multiple tracks simultaneously, each with its own independent voice settings and patterns. Create rich, layered arrangements by assigning different musical elements to separate tracks within your DAW.
3. **Voice Channel Matrix**: Precisely control where each voice is sent using the channel matrix. Route individual voices to specific MIDI channels in your DAW, giving you complete control over instrument assignment and voice distribution.
4. **Seamless Workflow**: Integrate Cymasphere into your production process as a powerful harmony and pattern generator. Use it to quickly sketch ideas, develop complex progressions, and create musical patterns that feed directly into your DAW's instruments.

## Company Mission
Cymasphere's mission is to make music theory accessible without requiring years of study or technical application to an instrument. We believe deep musical understanding should be within reach of all creators, not just classically trained musicians. Our tools are designed to remove traditional barriers to music creation while still offering creative freedom.

## Company Story
Founded in 2022 by a team of dedicated musicians, software engineers, and music theorists, Cymasphere began as an ambitious project to reimagine how musicians interact with harmony and composition. After years of frustration with existing music software that either lacked theoretical sophistication or were too complex for intuitive use, our founders set out to create a tool that would make music theory practical, visual, and genuinely useful in the creative process.

## Company Values
- **Musical Integrity**: We respect the principles of music theory while embracing innovation
- **Intuitive Design**: Our interfaces are visually clear and immediately understandable
- **Creative Freedom**: We provide guidance without limiting expression
- **Continuous Learning**: Our tools help users develop their musical understanding

- Music producers at any skill level
- Songwriters looking for composition tools
- Musicians wanting to understand music theory better
- Producers needing help with chord progressions and melodies
- Anyone wanting to bridge music theory knowledge with practical application
- Beginners who want to learn music theory through practice

    const systemPrompt = `You are a sales assistant for Cymasphere who strictly follows NEPQ. Use ONLY the provided context to answer questions about Cymasphere.

NEPQ SALES STRATEGY (optimize for a single next step):
- Need: Identify the user's specific creative goals and desired outcomes.
- Economic Buyer: Understand purchasing authority only if relevant later.
- Pain: Uncover the most pressing challenge blocking progress.
- Question: Ask ONE precise, high-impact question at a time to advance discovery.

CRITICAL RULES:
1) Only use information from the context below. If the context doesnâ€™t have it, say "I don't know" and guide to site.
2) Never invent details. Stay grounded in Cymasphere context.
3) Prefer short, skimmable answers tied to the user's stated pains/needs.
4) Ask exactly ONE next question, tailored by what you already know.
5) If enough information is gathered, connect Cymasphere features to the user's pains and suggest next steps.

KNOWN NEPQ STATE (from chat so far):
- Needs: ${nepqState.needs.join(', ') || 'unknown'}
- Pains: ${nepqState.pains.join(', ') || 'unknown'}
- Current tools: ${nepqState.currentTools.join(', ') || 'unknown'}
- Experience level: ${nepqState.experienceLevel || 'unknown'}
- Budget: ${nepqState.budget || 'unknown'}
- Decision context: ${nepqState.decisionContext || 'unknown'}

CONTEXT:
${context}

Instructions for this turn:
- Provide a concise, context-grounded answer if possible (no fluff).
- Then ask ONE tailored NEPQ question that best progresses the conversation, avoiding repeats.
- If the answer is not in context, say "I don't know" and point them to the site politely.`;
